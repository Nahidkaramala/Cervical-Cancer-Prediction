# Cervical-Cancer-Prediction
This Projects helps in predicting a patient at risk of  Cervical cancer based on the Data provided 
##Overview
This repository contains code for predicting cervical cancer using machine learning algorithms. Cervical cancer is a major cause of mortality among women worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can assist in early identification of cervical cancer risk factors.
##Dataset
(Kaggle Data Set)["https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranzeet013/cervical-cancer-dataset"]
##Methods
We explored various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to build predictive models. We performed feature engineering and preprocessing to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. Model evaluation was conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).
